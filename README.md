A light-weight CNN for Bird species classification
# Conclusion
Our model works on the principle based on the detection of parts and extracting CNN features from multiple convolutional layers.
These features are given to the classifier for the classification purpose.
On the basis of the results obtained, our model has provided 99% accuracy in prediction of finding bird species.
